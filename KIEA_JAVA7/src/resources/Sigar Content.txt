	 * PTQL (Process Table Query Language)
	 * 
	 * Hyperic SIGAR provides a mechanism to identify processes called Process Table Query Language.
	 * All operating systems assign a unique id (PID) to each running process. However, the PID is
	 * a random number that may also change at any point in time when a process is restarted. PTQL
	 * uses process attributes that will persist over time to identify a process.
	 * 
	 * Class.Attribute.operator=value
	 * 
	 *     e.g.) Exe.Name.ct=Program Files
	 * 
	 * Class.Attribute
	 * 
	 *     Pid.Pid        - The process ID
	 *     Pid.PidFile    - File containing the process ID
	 *     Pid.Service    - Windows Service name used to pid from the service manager
	 *     State.Name     - Base name of the process executable
	 *     CredName.User  - User Name of the process owner
	 *     CredName.Group - Group Name of the process owner
	 *     Cred.Uid       - User ID of the process owner
	 *     Cred.Gid       - Group ID of the process owner
	 *     Cred.Euid      - Effective User ID of the process owner
	 *     Cred.Egid      - Effective Group ID of the process owner
	 *     Exe.Name       - Full path name of the process executable
	 *     Exe.Cwd        - Current Working Directory of the process
	 *     Args.*         - Command line argument passed to the process
	 *     Env.*          - Environment variable within the process
	 *     Modules.*      - Shared library loaded within the process
	 *     
	 * operator for String values
	 * 
	 *     eq - equal to value
	 *     ne - not equal to value
	 *     ew - ends with value
	 *     sw - start with value
	 *     ct - contains value (substring)
	 *     re - regular expression value matches
	 *     Pne - Parent process not equal to value
	 *     
	 * operator for Numeric values
	 * 
	 *     eq - equal to value
	 *     ne - not equal to value
	 *     gt - greater than value
	 *     ge - greater than or equal value
	 *     lt - less than value
	 *     le - less than or equal value
	 *     
	 * e.g.) do not make a space in the below
	 * 
	 *     State.Name.eq = crond
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.eq = sshd
	 *     
	 *     Pid.PidFile.eq = /var/run/sshd.pid
	 *     
	 *     Pid.Service.eq = Eventlog
	 *     
	 *     Pid.Service.eq = sshd
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.re = ^(https?d.*|[Aa]pache2?)$
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.eq = httpd, State.Name.Pne = httpd
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.eq = httpd, State.Name.Pne = $1   <- $1 is the return value of the attribute (State.Name)
	 *                                                     in the first branch of the query
	 *     
	 *     CredName.User.eq = dougm, State.Name.eq = httpd, State.Name.Pne = $2 <- the return value of State.Name
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.eq = java
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.sw = java
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.eq = java, Args.7.eq = org.jboss.Main
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.eq = java, Args.-1.eq = org.jboss.Main
	 *     
	 *     State.Name.eq = java, Args.*.eq = org.jboss.Main
